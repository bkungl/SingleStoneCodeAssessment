# SingleStone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
It is a responsively-designed Single Page Application using Angular 9. The files are constructed using HTML, CSS, and Typescript. The functions that call data from the REST api are written in JavaScript. There were no extraneous libraries or frameworks required to build this project.

## You can view (most of) this project without downloading any files at https://bkungl.github.io/SingleStoneCodeAssessment/
Note: I was unable to figure out with the fonts and SVG file couldn't be built for deploymeny to a production environment so the page above does not utilize the font pack or the SVG image. If these are to be viewed, please use the following instructions.

## File Explanation
There is both a minified version as well as a non-minified, human-viewable code version. Both run the same. The minified src folder is 584 KB while the non-minified is 1.53 MB.

## First Time Setup
Clone/download repository to a folder. In the minified file directory, run the command `npm install` to download the node modules required to run an Angular project. Then, to see a dev build, use the following commands. NOTE: This will take longer than normal to run a development server. If this project was to be deployed to production this would be a different case. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
