# SingleStone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
It is a responsively-designed Single Page Application using Angular 9. The files are constructed using HTML, CSS, and Typescript. The functions that call data from the REST API are written in JavaScript. There were no extraneous libraries or frameworks required to build this project.

## File Explanation
There is both a minified version as well as a non-minified, human-viewable code version. Both run the same. The **minified src folder is 584 KB while the non-minified is 1.53 MB**.

## First Time Setup
Clone/download repository to a folder. In the minified file directory, run the command `npm install` to download the node modules required to run an Angular project. Then, to see a dev build, use the following commands. NOTE: This will take longer than normal to run a development server. If this project was to be deployed to production this would be a different case. 

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## I attempted to host the project for viewing (without downloading anything) at https://bkungl.github.io/SingleStoneCodeAssessment/
I had complications with this such as having my file paths corrupted and being unable to load my assets and some styling. I hosted https://www.d150fueling.com/ similarly with more success.
